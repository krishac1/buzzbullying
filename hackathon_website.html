    <p>
      There are various types of bullying that are affecting kids in Cupertino,
      such as cyber bullying, physical bullying, social bullying, and verbal bullying.
      All types of bullying negatively affect the bullies, the bullied, and the bystanders.
      Mental health and substance use are both linked to bullying. The best thing to do
      is seek out help from parents, teachers, or counselors, but 70-80% of students do
      not feel comfortable openly talking about their issues. Our website is made to help
      students get the help they need anonymously. Just sign up for a free account to get started!
